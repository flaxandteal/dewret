# Renderers

_Renderers_ are a function that takes a [task](/reference/dewret/workflow/#task), which can
be assumed to have a `__workflow__` member of type [Workflow](/reference/dewret/workflow/#workflow), and return
a YAML-serializable nested `dict` structure.


## CWL

The default renderer is for the Common Workflow Language. It implements a very small subset
of functionality, and is not yet strictly standards compliant. It assumes that all `run`
names can be interpreted in the context of the workflow module's global scope.
